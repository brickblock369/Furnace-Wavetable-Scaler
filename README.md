# Furnace-Wavetable-Scaler
Made to be used with [Furnace, developed by tildearrow.](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace)

This Python script is meant to be used whenever you want to raise the waveform's height for extra bit-depth and want to scale the waveform data based on that.

While yes, Furnace automatically aliases the waveforms whenever they use a height that's not supported by the sound chip, I however made this script in case people want to use the scaled waveform as the base to modify it even more, as it has more bit depth room to finely tweak the values.
